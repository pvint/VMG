# VMG
VMG - Velocity Made Good is designed with sailing in mind to help determine the best point of sail for making progress to a destination. By a long-press on the map you place a marker and the app shows you your distance, heading, speed over ground, and, most importantly, your Velocity Made Good towards the mark. This is the rate at which you are actually getting closer to the destination.This is valuable information when sailing close-hauled upwind, as often we can see a drastic increase in boat speed when falling off the wind a bit, but we wonder "is that getting me there sooner?". This app aims to answer that question.
